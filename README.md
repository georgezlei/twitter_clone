# Twitter Clone

This project is to demo the latest front-end technologies by creating a Twitter UI using the following technology.

* React.js
* TypeScript
* Webpack
* Sass

A [live demostration](https://vigilant-golick-65c0c8.netlify.app/) is hosted on Netify.

## Features
### Responsive design

The page uses the responsive design principle so the content can adapt to browsers of all devices from mobile phones to computers, and maintain the visual aesthetics. 

### Rendering on the data format of Twitter API

The data used in this app was directly fetched from Twitter API and served as the static data file. So theoretically this app has the potential to be improved to a full-function Twitter client.

The following tweet types are supported has dedicated renderer.

* Text tweet
* Tweets with media (photo, etc)
* Retweet
* Retweet with comment

### Interaction

New tweets can be edited and sent from the top edit box. Please note that this is only a demo project, the new tweet is not actually sent to the server.
